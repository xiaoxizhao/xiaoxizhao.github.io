Welcome to my website! 

I am an associate economist at RAND Corporation. I recieved my Ph.D. in Economics from Boston University.

My fields of interest are health economics and industrial organization. I am particularly interested in public policies and vertical relationships in health insurance markets and health care provider markets. In my research, I employ both reduced-form and structural models to examine market participant behavior, exploring the mechanisms behind it, and expanding our understanding of policy questions.
